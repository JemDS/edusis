This is our Software Capstone Project; eduSIS (Educator and Student Interative System)

In the Jamaican education system, there is a considerable hindrance in the effectiveness of educating students due to barriers in accessing the required school textbooks and resources. These barriers include high fees for textbooks given the current economic climate and the limited quantities in bookstores. As a result, studentsâ€™ participation in classes have been tremendously impaired caused by the lack of necessary resources required to study and learn. Other effects are found in cases where pupils fail to submit graded assignments and perform poorly in examinations. Additionally, educators receive low appraisal scores be it that their students are underperforming. Students also become demotivated considering the lack of resources.

Resultantly, our proposed solution, eduSISS, engages the stakeholders of the classroom online. The digital platform hosts a plethora of school textbooks and resources that will enable a streamlined learning process in classes and provide a myriad of benefits to students and to educators.

EduSIS, is an online platform that provides textbooks in digitized formats allowing students at all levels to have higher accessibility to resources for learning. It will also enable classroom virtualization to facilitate online workbook activities for in class and homework assignments. Its purpose is to eradicate the aforementioned barriers as well as to improve education delivery and student learning.
